### [tuchk4.github.io/css-in-js-app](https://tuchk4.github.io/css-in-js-app)

There is React application with implemented different css-in-js approaches:

- [rockey](https://github.com/tuchk4/rockey)
- [Glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor)
- [Fela](https://github.com/rofrischmann/fela)
- [Aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite)
- [JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss)
- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)

Each bundle is lazy initializing (so for better results update page before test to keep initialized only current bundle). Also
there are:

- Timers for rendering 1000 same components and 1000 different components with styles defined in JS.
- Checkbox to switch `primary` property
- Input to change text
- Links to source code of each bundle
